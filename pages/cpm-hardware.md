# Hardware Components (CPM)

## Definitions

-   Terminal = the device used to connect to the computer
-   CP/M programs all have a name associated with them

## Interfaces

-   Console/Terminal <-> Computer (which has CPU and Memory) <-> Peripherals (floppy disk back and forth, line printer out)
-   Early computers had operator consoles with lights, switches, and patch cords for program input. Like the Altair!

## The TTY

-   The TTY was originally used for input/output.
-   It was replaced by the CRT and electric keyboard

## Integrated Circuits

-   CPU was initially a separate rack with circuit boards, later integrated circuits reduced size.
-   Intel 8080 instruction set became standard - CP/M was written in this, and the Altair uses the 8080

## Memory

-   Instructions are stored in memory (RAM)
-   ROM = Read Only Memory
-   PROM = Programmable ROM
-   65k of memory

## Storage & Output

-   Disks store data in tracks and sectors
-   Line printer will be used for input/output
-   Floppy disks are used for storage
-   Modem is used to connect to other computers
